		        <h2>Werner Heisenberg</h2>
		        <p>
		        	According to wikipedia: Werner Karl Heisenberg ; 5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976)[3] was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. He is known for the uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927. Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics "for the creation of quantum mechanics"

            		Nikola Tesla ( 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

	        	<h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
	        	<p>
	        		Albert Einstein ( 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[5] universally acknowledged to be one of the two greatest physicists of all time, the other being Isaac Newton. Einstein developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[3][6] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from the theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[7] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".[11]
